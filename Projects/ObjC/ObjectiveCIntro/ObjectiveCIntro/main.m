/*
 Brief tangent:
 What is a REPL
    - reads, evaluates, prints( loop that does this)
 Most coding interviews will be in a repl, not in Xcode
 some examples: coderpad.io, repl.it
 
 Compilers for multiple languages (built by Apple way back when) called CLANG.
 Both of these communicate with a system called LLVM to actually run your code
 
 can create an executable file using clang

 Objc refresher
 Syntax is different:
 - when declaring a var, we start with the type that that instance will be
 -var a = 10? keyword var doesn't exist
 and there's no type inference
 
 We'll have to manage the memory (sometimes)
 Ex: autoreleasepool sets a scp[e for you to declare variables, do stuff with them, and then at the end of the block, whatever is in memory will be told to release
 
 Object-Oriented Language! (OOP)
 - not protocol oriented -> so true
 - 4 pillars: encapsulation, inheritance, abstraction, polymorphism
 
 First! We're gonna talk about the funtionality that ObjC gets from a different language
 
 Swift compiles into Swift, which compiles into some Swift-y kind of thing (SIL) and then gets set up to be actual instructions to the computer
 
 ObjC does not compile to itself. C and its funtionality sit below ObjC, and so when we compile our code, at one poit all the stuff we write will be in C. After that, it'll get set up to be actial instructions to the computer.
 
 Digression: most languages compile to an intermediary language called Assempbly, which is the layer of code that gets translated to hardware of our computers.
 Digression over.
