//we need to subclass NSObject so that I can inherit functionalities. The most improtant are alloc and init
//- alloc points to a spot in memory (allocates it) and init creates an instance in that space in memory.
//Important: because we are using inheritance, if there are no implemented methods/properties, we'd only be able to use the ones inherited from NSObject
@interface CarnivalBarker : NSObject

- (instancetype)init;
//-(id)init;
//id is part of initializer. the same object that's being initialized? instead of saying self.type or something?
//id and instancetype are not the same when we fight with inheritance and polymorphism
